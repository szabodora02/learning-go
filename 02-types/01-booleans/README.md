# Logical operators

Solve the below exercises using boolean operands to represent logical values.

1. Write a function that returns the logical *inverse* of a logical value. Use the below signature:

   ```go
   func inverse(b bool) bool
   ```

2. Write a function that returns the logical "AND" of two logical values. Use the below signature:

   ```go
   func and(x, y bool) bool
   ```

3. Write a function called `deMorgan` that takes two logical operands $A$ and $B$, returns $\overline{A \cup B}$. You cannot use the built-in logical operators of Go in this function, only the two functions implemented above. Use the below /De Morgan equation/ to obtain a form that you can express given the above two functions.

   $$\overline{A \cup B} = \overline{A} \cap \overline{B}$$

   You can use the signature below for your function:

   ```go
   func deMorgan(a, b bool) bool
   ```
